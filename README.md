# neuralnet
Home brew -- only uses random and math libraries

This isn't meant to be production level code -- It's slow and single threaded.  I wrote this to expand my understanding of the internals of neural networks.  There's still work to be done on it, but it more or less works (See the contained jupyter notebook for its use on the Iris dataset provided by scikit-learn for a demonstration).
